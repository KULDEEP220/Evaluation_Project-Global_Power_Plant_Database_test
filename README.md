# Evaluation_Project-Global_Power_Plant_Database_test
Aim: Need To Predict Primary Fuel And Capacity_mw For Global Power Plant Dataset.
Problem Statment:
An affordable, reliable, and environmentally sustainable power sector is central to modern society. Governments, utilities, and companies make decisions that both affect and depend on the power sector. For example, if governments apply a carbon price to electricity generation, it changes how plants run and which plants are built over time. On the other hand, each new plant affects the electricity generation mix, the reliability of the system, and system emissions. Plants also have significant impact on climate change, through carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions; on water stress, through water withdrawal and consumption; and on air quality, through sulfur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter (PM) emissions.

The Global Power Plant Database is an open-source open-access dataset of grid-scale (1 MW and greater) electricity generating facilities operating across the world.

The actual Database currently contains nearly 35000 power plants in 167 countries, representing about 72% of the world's capacity. Entries are at the facility level only, generally defined as a single transmission grid connection point. Generation unit-level information is not currently available.

But in our study we will be working on the dataset only for INDIA. The data set contains only 908 rows and 25 columns. The data set provides information of all the power plant situated at diffrent loactions in india.
